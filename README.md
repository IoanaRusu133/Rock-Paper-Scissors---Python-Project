# Rock, Paper, Scissors - Python Game 🪨 📄 ✂️

This project is the implementation of the exercise from **Section 7** of the **"100 Days of Code™: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** course by **Angela Yu** on Udemy.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal was to create an interactive command-line version of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using Python, focusing on:
* Generating random choices for the computer.
* Using complex conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
* Manipulating multi-line strings for ASCII Art.
* Handling user input.

## 🕹️ How It Works
1. The user makes a selection by typing a number:
   * `0` for **Rock**
   * `1` for **Paper**
   * `2` for **Scissors**
2. The computer generates a random choice.
3. The program displays the ASCII Art representations for both selections.
4. The winner is determined based on classic game rules.

## 🛠️ Python Concepts Implemented
* **`random` Module**: Used to generate the computer's choice via `random.randint`.
* **Control Flow**: Evaluation of all possible win/loss/tie scenarios.
* **ASCII Art**: Utilizing multi-line string constants to visualize the game elements.
